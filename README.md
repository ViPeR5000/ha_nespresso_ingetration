Nespresso Bluetooth integration for Home Assistant.

Originally intended to be a fork of the work from tikismoke but has morphed significantly and the original work is no longer under development i've decided to create a new project home.

Thank you to tikismoke and all those before him who helped reverse engineer the protocols.

This project is still a work in progress

# Features
* Native configuration flow for Hoem Assistant
* Device discovery
* Direct pairing/auth (No need to extract auth_key from mobile app)
* Reworked to use the native Home Assistant bleak bluetooth library
